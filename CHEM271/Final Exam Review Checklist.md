- [ ] You should know the names of the enzymes and the reactions they catalyze.
- [ ] You should know how glycogen metabolism is regulated in liver and in muscle.
- [ ] You should know all the levels where phosphorylation/dephosphorylation regulates glycogen metabolism, as well as how. 
- [ ] You should know how the cell controls whether glycogen is degraded or synthesized.

## Citric acid cycle
- [ ] You should know that role of the citric acid cycle and how it is connected to other energy generating pathways 
- [ ] You should know about mitochondria and where cellular respiration takes place
- [ ] You should know how pyruvate gets converted into acetyl-CoA.
- [ ] You should know the names of all the reactants in the citric acid cycle as well as names of all the enzymes.
- [ ] You should know the mechanisms of the enzymes that we covered in class
- [ ] You should know where CO2 is released, where NADH, FADH2 and GTP (ATP) is produced. **You do NOT have to be able to draw the structures**
- [ ] You should know which enzymes are regulated and how.
- [ ] You should know about anaplerotic pathways including the glyoxalate cycle (no structures)

**Reminder:** You should be able to recognize the structures of all the cofactors/coenzymes and identify the reactive part of the molecule as well as what kinds of reactions they participate in. This also refers to cofactors we have seen previously.

## Bioenergetics

- [ ] You should know the Nernst equation and how to use it
- [ ] You should know how many electrons are involved in common redox reactions, such as NAD+/NADH
- [ ] You should know about the membrane potential, you do not have to know the equation for calculating the potential

## Electron transport
- [ ] You should know what the mitochondrion looks like, where electron transport takes place and why it is membrane bound 
- [ ] For each of the four complexes you should know what the electron donors and acceptors are, the redox centers in the proteins and how electrons move in the complexes. 
- [ ] You should know where, how and how many protons are pumped across the mitochondrial membrane. 
- [ ] You should know about reactive oxygen species, and the enzymes that can remove them.

           

## ATP synthesis
You should know:
- [ ] What the proton motive force is
- [ ] Which polypeptides make up the F1 and F0 subunits

- [ ] What the ATP synthasome is

## Oxidative phosphorylation
You should know:
- [ ] How electron transport is coupled to ATP synthesis and how it can become uncoupled
- [ ] How synthesis of ATP regulates the activities of the citric acid cycle

## Integration with metabolism

 Much of the regulation is just a summary of what we have already covered. These are all regulatory mechanisms that you should know from previous material.
The material on diabetes and the function of insulin is included for your information, it is not something you have to study for the exam.
